# Gake

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/tmus/gake)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/tmus/gake)

Gake is a Make-inspired task runner for the Go language.

It (initially) serves as both an opportunity for me to learn Make at a deeper
level, and also to create a Go package that can be used by others.

Gake will aim for feature parity with Make.

As such, it shouldn't be relied upon for serious projects.
